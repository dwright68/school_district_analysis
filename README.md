# school_district_analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to provide an anonymized breakdown of performance across a school district. We will use multiple points of comparison to determine how different factors influence performance in these schools. 

The factors we'll be comparing are
  - Performance By Grades
  - Performance By Spending(Per Student)
  - Performance By School Size
  - Performance By School Type(Charter vs District)

### Disclaimer
There was a school in this analysis that had some dishonesty in reporting, so Thomas High School Grade 9 has been removed from this analysis. We will also be discussing the differences that removing these scores brought. 

## Top Performing Schools

As pictured above we see the top 5 performing schools within this analysis. We do see that Thomas High School is within the top 5 even with the 9th grade scores taken out of the equation. In the original equation Thomas High School performed less than one point better across all categories. 

## School District Breakdown

Above are a district breakdown taken before and after the scores were adjusted for Thomas High School. We can see some slight differences in all categories except Average Reading Score, but all are within half a point of each other. 

## By School Breakdown

![Schools Breakdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88564212/135377132-210505d9-64b0-4064-b5ff-c607548a28d1.png)

Above we can see the breakdwon by school in ascending order, with Bailey High School being the lowest performing school and Wright High School being the top performing school. 

We can zoom in on Thomas High School with the following two images. 

![Old School Breakdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88564212/135377886-14c60af9-b6df-4857-97e4-5a9b6c4bf5c1.png)

![New School Breakdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88564212/135377920-c15c071e-e2d8-4cd8-b488-a7d0ed9a8549.png)

Comparing the two images (the first being the old and the second being the new) we can see again that this has made a less than 1 point difference across the board. 


## By Spending(Per Student) Breakdown 
![By Spending Breakdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88564212/135379464-633992bc-eb8b-4e98-b4fc-23cec6aa22bc.png)

Based off the above breaddown, we can see that as the spending per student goes up the overall passing percentages go down. While this is a noticeable trend I believe that the main driver here is school size and school type. These things will be discussed further below.

## By School Size

![By School Size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88564212/135380339-3768d419-238e-4744-8d64-a9922fc8be7f.png)

We can see in the above image that schools with <1000 students up to 2000 students perform simalarly to one another, but once the size of the school starts to go beyond 2000 the overall passing performance startss to dramatically drop. We can see that while the Average Reading Score is relatively close to the others, the math score is much lower. This paired with a higher percentage of students failing reading leads to a less than 60% passing rate compared to the other schools having 89% and above.

## By School Type
![By School Type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88564212/135380651-fe4c9087-108c-43a3-8b17-ef017deac65f.png)

The above image shows the key factor of performance in these schools. We can see again that average reading scores in district schools were relatively close, but every other item saw a drastic difference. The overall passing rate in charter schools was at 90% where district schools saw 54%. Charter schools also had less students for the most part, so it does seem that school size and school type are the key to success here. 


### Summary

In review we can see that removing the ninth-graders scores from the analysis did have some impact to the overall structure, but not as much as one might think. Overall the school still performed very well in the other grades allowing them to stay high in the rankings despite losing the ninth grade scores.

 - This was only a 461 student adjustment out of 39,170 students total. So the change in the statistics would be fairly small. 
 - The district summary only saw less than .5 point decrease across the board. 
 - The school summary would only see changes for Thomas High School. The biggest change we see is a ~.3% decrease in overall passing. 
 - Perhaps the most siginificant change we see in removing the students from this report was that the total students dropped enough to move Thomas High School into the Medium school bracket. That being said, Thomas High in the Large school break does not make a significant impact on the performance ratings of that size of school. 

All in all while removing these grades did have a negative impact on the schools scores, it was small to the point of being negligible. This is regarding reports when looking at all schools or just looking at Thomas High School.
